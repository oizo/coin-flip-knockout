# Coin Flip Knockout Tournament

## About This Project

This is a side project, written entirely using GitHub Copilot as a vibe coding experiment. The problem with vibe coding? I have no clue how the code works, and I'm determined it should stay that way.

This project was created entirely through interactive sessions with GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, without any manual coding outside of AI assistance. The design emphasizes simplicity, quick gameplay, and a fun knockout format, with all UI and logic decisions made collaboratively with Copilot and ChatGPT to focus on clarity and user experience. As for code review—only ChatGPT knows! Every part of the code, design, and documentation was reviewed and iterated by AI, making this a unique and experimental coding journey.
